# SQL-Projects
This SQL project is the data exploration of sales company data sets.
Data Exploration is the first step of data analysis used to explore and visualize data to uncover insights from the start or identify areas or patterns to dig into more.
Data exploration helps users make better decisions on where to dig deeper into the data and take a broad understanding of the business when asking more detailed questions later. 
With a user-friendly interface, anyone across an organization can familiarize themselves with the data, discover patterns, and generate thoughtful questions that may spur on deeper, valuable analysis.
Data exploration can help businesses explore large amounts of data quickly to better understand the next steps in terms of further analysis. 
This gives the business a more manageable starting point and a way to target areas of interest.
